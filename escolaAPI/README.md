# School Management Application

This project is a school management application that integrates data from a web service and transforms it into XML files. It utilizes various design patterns including Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, and Prototype to ensure a robust and maintainable architecture.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd SchoolManagementApp
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can use a package manager like NuGet to install any required libraries.

3. **Configure the Web Service**
   Update the `appsettings.json` file with the URL of the web service you want to consume.

4. **Run the Application**
   Use the command below to run the application:
   ```
   dotnet run
   ```

5. **Access the Application**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

## Design Patterns Used

- **Singleton**: Ensures a single instance of the data connection manager.
- **Factory Method**: Provides a method for creating Student and Course objects based on input data.
- **Abstract Factory**: Creates related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Prototype**: Allows cloning of Student and Course objects.
